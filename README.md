# wsb morning report archive

## Goals

Preserve the morning report posts on www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets in such a way that it's braindead easy to maintain, and has very low risk of any outside changes affecting it (i.e cloud solutions changing)

## Current Steps

Two separate steps.

### Part A: Scan
1. Retrieve new posts from users account
2. Check if name has been found before
3. Check if name matches morning report pattern
4. Retrieve post source

### Part B: Update
1. double check if post has been archived before
2. insert into google drive folder. Update Index.

## Things that would be nice

Ideally, Part A will be easily expandable for use with something other than google drive that can properly serve html directly.
